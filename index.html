<h1>GLOBAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT</h1>

Product is everything that is made/provided by the manufacturer to meet the market needs. Products required by certain market groups/segments may not be required by other market groups/segments.<br />
A product is defined by physical properties – weight, size and material. So a car can be defined as metal, plastic, or fiberglass glass weighing 6000 kilograms, measuring length 4.8 m etc. This definition can be expanded by including things like color, texture, style, shape and surface. However, marketers know that any description that is limited to the physical properties is complete, as there is not a slightest bit of the product being mentioned. Cars, for example, are a product that meets various needs. The most obvious necessity is the means of transport, but marketers cannot ignore the need for leisure, the important status and power and the desire that this product is satisfied with.<br />

Product Classification<br />
Products can be classified according to various criteria. The most old criteria are:<br />
<br />
1. Based on user<br />
2. Differentiated between consumer and industrial goods<br />
3. Then classified further, on the basis of how the goods were purchased (goods for comfort, pleasure, bought in the store, or special)<br />
4. According to age span (durable, consumables, or disposable)<br />
<br />
LOCAL PRODUCTS – INTERNATIONAL – GLOBAL<br />
<br />
It is very important to evaluate the proposed new product in the sense of its local-international-global potential. If all other things are the same, products with the ability to generate international-global profits are more attractive than products whose potential is essentially local. In general, a company should not add to a completely local product line if international or global product opportunities are available.<br />
There are 3 product categories, from local to global:<br />
<br />
1. Local Products<br />
Is a product that, in the context of the company TTN, is considered only has potential in 1 national market. For example: Aiwa makes a variety of products that are not sold outside Japan. Reason? Because Japanese consumers seem to have an insatiable appetite for electronic equipment.<br />
<br />
There are 3 reasons why the decision to market a local product can be a very costly opportunity, although it may generate profit:<br />
A. First, a single business does not provide the opportunity to develop by utilizing global power from the head office in marketing, R &amp;amp; D, production and other functional areas<br />
B. Local products do not provide transfers and applications for experience gained in 1 market to another market<br />
C. One-country product is managerial proficiency obtained in the field of single product is less transferable. The manager could only take advantage of his experience in the market only where the product was sold.<br />
<br />
2. International Products<br />
It is a product deemed to have the potential to expand to a number of national markets. Because industrial products tend to lack the sensitivity of the environment than consumer products, industrial manufacturing should mainly be wary of possible expansion. For example, Loctile Corporation is a factory worth $500 million of industrial glue and adhesive material sold in more than 80 countries. In 1991, 60% of company sales and 80% of profits came from overseas.<br />
<br />
3. Global Products<br />
This product is designed to meet the needs of global markets. For example Sonny markets a Walkman, providing personal music equipment that can be carried around the world.<br />
When an industry becomes global, the company is under pressure to develop global products. One of the main drivers of globalization is the cost of R &amp;amp; D products. When competition is increasingly strict, the company realizes that it can reduce the cost of R &amp;amp; D for a product by developing a global product design. Even products such as automobiles, which must meet the requirements of safety and national pollution standards, are under pressure to be global.<br />
